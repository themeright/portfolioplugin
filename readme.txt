"One Page Portfolio Plugin" made it easy to create one page portfolio using pinterest-like style.

== Description ==

The plugin can diplay all your works on one page using a shortcode[oppp]. You can choose one category as your portfolio category
then publish your works post one by one to the category. The page you add shortcode will display all your works using pinterest-like style. You can add tags to these posts, then choose which tags to filter these posts.
You can choose the thumbnails size to change the image size on the portfolio page, but before that you need set the feature images for every posts.
